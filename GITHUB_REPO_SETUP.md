## Creating a GitHub Repository

1. **Login to GitHub**:
   - Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and login with your account (chkarip)

2. **Create a New Repository**:
   - Click on the "+" icon in the top right corner
   - Select "New repository"
   - Enter repository name: `speed-reader`
   - Add a short description: "Flutter app for speed reading using RSVP technique"
   - Keep it as Public or Private based on your preference
   - **Do NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license** (since we already have these files)
   - Click "Create repository"

3. **After Creating the Repository**:
   - You'll see instructions for pushing an existing repository
   - We've already set up your local repository, so you just need to run:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/chkarip/speed-reader.git
git push -u origin main
```

4. **Authentication**:
   - You'll need to authenticate with GitHub
   - If you haven't set up SSH or a credential manager, you'll be prompted for your GitHub username and password
   - If you have 2FA enabled, you'll need to use a personal access token instead of your password

Let me know once you've created the repository on GitHub, and I'll help you push the code.
