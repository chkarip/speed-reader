Speed reading is a collection of reading methods which attempt to increase rates of reading without greatly reducing comprehension or retention. Methods include chunking and eliminating subvocalization. The many available speed reading training programs may utilize books, videos, software, and seminars.

There is little scientific evidence regarding speed reading, and as a result its value is controversial. Cognitive neuroscientist Stanislas Dehaene says that claims of reading up to 1,000 words per minute must be viewed with skepticism.

The term speed reading comprises a range of techniques for improving reading speed. These include skimming, scanning, and rapid sequential visual presentation. Speed reading methods often focus on reducing subvocalization, the inner voice that reads along silently.

Research has shown that reading speed can be improved through practice and training. However, there is often a trade-off between reading speed and comprehension. The optimal reading speed varies depending on the material and the reader's purpose.

Modern speed reading apps use techniques like RSVP (Rapid Serial Visual Presentation) where words are displayed one at a time at a rapid pace. This forces the reader to focus on each word without the ability to regress or re-read previous words.

The benefits of speed reading include improved productivity, better time management, and the ability to process large amounts of information quickly. However, critics argue that speed reading may compromise deep understanding and critical thinking.
